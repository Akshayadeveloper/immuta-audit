# immuta-audit
Focus: Provable object immutability and deep state verification in distributed systems.

<b>Core Problem Solved</b>
Prevents subtle, non-deterministic bugs in large systems by creating a deep structural hash of critical objects and dependencies. This allows for verification of state integrity across asynchronous operations, microservices, and serialization boundaries, ensuring an object has not been mutated where it shouldn't have been.

<b>The Solution Mechanism (Python)</b>
We use a recursive hashing mechanism that ensures every nested list, dictionary, and object attribute is accounted for, providing an ironclad integrity check.
